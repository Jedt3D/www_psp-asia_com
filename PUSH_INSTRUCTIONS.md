# Instructions for Pushing Rebased Workfiles

## Option 1: Push directly to the repository

If you have write access to the repository, run:

```bash
git push origin rebased-workfiles
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub to merge these changes into the main branch.

## Option 2: Push to your own fork

If you don't have write access to the original repository:

1. Create a fork of https://github.com/everysundays/PSPA-Website.git on GitHub
2. Add your fork as a remote:

```bash
git remote add myfork https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PSPA-Website.git
git push myfork rebased-workfiles
```

3. Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository

## Option 3: Create a Git bundle

If you want to share these changes without using GitHub:

```bash
git bundle create pspa-rebased-workfiles.bundle rebased-workfiles
```

This will create a file called `pspa-rebased-workfiles.bundle` that contains all the commits. 
You can share this file with someone else, and they can import it using:

```bash
# In their repository
git bundle verify pspa-rebased-workfiles.bundle
git pull pspa-rebased-workfiles.bundle rebased-workfiles
```
